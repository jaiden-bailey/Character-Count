# Character-Count
Created a code that takes an inputted letter, reads a file and returns how many instances of that letter are in the file. 
Utilizes a function that counts the instances of the letter using a for loop.
Included fstream to allow the manipulation of files in the code. 
Future goals are to create a menu to allow the user to choose if they want to read from a inputted phrase or from the file, and add a function for word count.
