# Character Count Utility

This repository contains a code implementation designed to determine the frequency of a specific letter within a given input or a file. The program is equipped with a dedicated function that employs a for loop to efficiently count the occurrences of the specified letter.

To facilitate file handling operations, the code leverages the "fstream" library, enabling seamless manipulation of files within the program.

## Future Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly menu system that offers options to either read from an inputted phrase or directly from a file.
- Implement an additional function to perform word count analysis for enhanced utility.
